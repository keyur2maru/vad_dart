# vad_dart - Voice Activity Detection Bindings for Dart

This is a Dart wrapper for [ricky0123/vad](https://github.com/ricky0123/vad), providing real-time voice activity detection in Flutter iOS/Android/Web. The library allows for voice detection with fine-grained control using `dart:js_interop` for Web and `flutter_inapp_webview` for iOS/Android, making it ideal for voice-activated applications.
